Create a development configuration file at `configuration/ccloud.properties` with your Confluent Cloud information.
This file and the secrets it contains can be easily created using the Confluent Cloud UI. To do so, from the Confluent Cloud UI, navigate to the
``Clients`` section in your cluster, click ``Create Kafka cluster API key & secret`` and ``Create Schema Registry API key & secret``,
and select ``Java`` as the client. Lastly make sure ``Show API keys`` is checked.
You should see something similar to below in the UI. Copy the contents of the configuration file and paste them into a
`cconfiguration/cloud.properties` file on your local machine.
