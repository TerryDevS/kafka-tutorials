Create a development configuration file at `configuration/dev.properties` with your Confluent Cloud information.
This file and the secrets it contains can be easily created using the Confluent Cloud UI. To do so, navigate to the
``Clients`` section in your cluster, click ``Create Kafka cluster API key & secret`` and ``Create Schema Registry API key & secret``,
lastly select ``Java`` as the client. You should see something similar to below in the UI. Copy the contents of the configuration file and paste them into a
`configuration/ccloud.properties` file on your local machine.
