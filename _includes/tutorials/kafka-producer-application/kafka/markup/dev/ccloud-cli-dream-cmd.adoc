Use the Confluent Cloud CLI to create a test environment, cluster, and user account with global access with the command below:
```
ccloud this-command-doesnt-exist fake-create-fancy-test-cluster-not-real-command
```
After running the command above, you should see output similar to the following (but actually you'll see nothing because above isn't real and requires a product enhancement):
```
Creating Confluent Cloud stack for service account demo-app-1234, ID: 12345.
Set Kafka cluster "lkc-xyz123" as the active cluster for environment "env-abc123".

Waiting up to 720 seconds for Confluent Cloud cluster to be ready and for credentials to propagate
.....
Sleeping an additional 80 seconds to ensure propagation of all metadata
Set API Key "ABC123ABC123" as the active API key for "lkc-123abc".

Client configuration file saved to: stack-configs/java-service-account-12345.config
